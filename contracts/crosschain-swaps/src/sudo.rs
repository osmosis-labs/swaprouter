/// The chain needs to verify that the ack is valid ack for the packet with  the matching
/// source_channel and sequence before calling this function.
///
/// If the contract didn't send the IBC packet with (source_channel, sequence), we return a
/// success and no other changes are made.
///
/// If this contract sent the IBC packet, its data will be stored in
/// INFLIGHT_PACKETS. At this point the ack can be a success or a failure.
///
/// If it's a success, we remove the inflight packet and return. The packet will
/// no longer be tracked.
///
/// If it's a failure, the sent funds will have been returned to this contract.
/// We then store the amount and original sender on RECOVERY_STATES so that the
/// sender can recover the funds by calling execute::Recover{}.
